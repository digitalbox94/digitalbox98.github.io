<h2>About the project</h2>

Dawn of Light allows you to host and connect to your own DAOC servers

<h2>What is Dawn of Light?</h2>

Founded in March 2003 Dawn of Light (DOL) is the first free open source server emulator for Dark Age of Camelot (DAOC). Dawn of Light allows the community to create their own servers and custom content. DOL is written in C# using the .NET Framework, and using a MySQL database server on Windows machine.

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

Dawn of Light is an Open Source project devoted to emulating Dark Age of Camelot. In emulating Dark Age of Camelot we pledge to strictly conform to live servers, yet also design the code to allow the community to create custom servers through scripts.

<h2>Is Dawn of Light Legal ?</h2>

Playing on a Dawn of Light powered server

If you use your DAOC Client to connect to a Dawn of Light powered server you are violating your EULA with Mythic. This gives them the right to close your live DAOC account if they find out.
